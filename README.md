# juste un autre éditeur de text
this is a learning-by-doing toy project that gets me re-familiar with c++

will be using the [NANA](http://nanapro.org/en-us/) GUI library

the main refs are [Data Structures for Text Sequences](https://www.cs.unm.edu/~crowley/papers/sds/sds.html) by Charles Crowley, University of New Mexico

and [The Craft of Text Editing](http://www.finseth.com/craft/index.html) by Craig A. Finseth
